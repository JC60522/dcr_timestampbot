This is v0.0.1 of dcr-timestampbot. This project is inspired by friendly enquiry of https://github.com/tiagoalvesdulce/dcrtimestamptweet.

The request was to fix some issues as well giving me the opportunity to rebuild & maintain this twitter bot in a language I feel comfortable with. 
My current language of choice is Python.

This README as well as the codebase will most likely see some updates in the near future as the bot needs to go through some testing etc. before activation.

The bot will have an accompanying bare bones front-end where timestamped - ipfs logged tweets can be viewed at: https://dcr-timestampbot.com 
The idea of this is to host an IPFS node specifically dedicated to the timestamped tweets for easy retrieval - linked to the front end. The ipfs url in the tweets
will land on the user on this front-end displaying the query result.
